        <h1>The Little Elephant Who Lost His Voice</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 30px";>
            Once upon a time, in a bright green jungle, there lived a little elephant named Muthu.
Muthu was kind, playful, and very noisy. He loved trumpeting all day:

“Prrrrooo! Prrrrooo!”

One morning, after shouting extra loud during a game, Muthu tried to trumpet again…
But no sound came out!
“Uh-oh!” thought Muthu.
“I’ve lost my voice!”

He walked to the wise parrot teacher and pointed to his mouth.
The parrot laughed and said,
“Maybe your voice is tired. Go and help others quietly today.”

So Muthu helped the ants cross a river 
shaded the monkeys from the hot sun 
and gently lifted a tired turtle up a hill 

He didn’t shout.
He didn’t trumpet.
He just smiled and helped.

That night, the moon shone brightly. 
Muthu tried to trumpet again—

“PRRROOO!” 

His voice was back!
And this time, it sounded sweeter than ever.

From that day, Muthu learned:
 Kindness speaks louder than noise.
